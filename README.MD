Throughout the course of creating this game of Etch-a-Sketch, I had to become familiar with the following concepts:
  1) Seperating my code into smaller more specific functions.
  2) Using the debugger and setting proper breakpoints, assigning values to watch and using scope.
  3) Solving CSS issues by using the debugger's Computed Styles. 
  4) Letting users dictate CSS values such as quantities of grid items in a grid by concatenating strings and input values
  5) Using for loops to generate multiple HTML elements through DOM manipulation
  6) Using an addEventListener button to remove all the previously generated elements by looping through an array of them and using removeChild
  7) How different colors work together on the front-end, and which colors go together well with each other
  8) How to use branches to create various development features, which got merged into the main branch each time they were ready for production

It's been a challenging project, and quickly grew exponentially more difficult than I expected, but this only makes me more excited to tackle future projects.
