This will be a javascript project that uses javascript to create a 16x16 grid of square divs. They will be inside of another container directly in the html, and will be styled to arrange as a grid through the use of CSS Grid. 

After the grid is created, a hover effect will be added to change the divs color when the mouse passes over then.

After the hover effect, a button will be added to the top of the screen to clear the grid and send the user a prompt popup asking for the user how many squares the user would like per side of the grid. The new grid should be generated in the same space as before, with 100 grids per side maximum.
